 Chrome extension - WGU Task Dark Mode by DK
 
 A Chrome extension that adds dark mode and large font size options for Western Governors University task pages. 

 The large font size option is located in the context menu (right-click). It makes the text larger without making the buttons in the left pane bigger, which would take away too much content space and make everything harder to read, defeating the purpose of making the text bigger.

 Clicking the browser action button or selecting the Dark Mode context menu item will toggle Dark Mode for ALL open WGU Task pages. The large font size option works the same way.

 The setting is remembered and applied to task pages upon navigation.

 Covers task pages only, not course pages or textbooks.

 The context menu (right-click) items only appear on WGU task pages (https://tasks.wgu.edu/*).

 This is a work in progress that will be updated to include a browser action menu that includes both the dark mode and large font size options.

 This will eventually be in the Chrome Web Store. For now, you must download the ZIP and put the contents somewhere and then load it as an unpacked extension in Chrome. Follow the first three steps here: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/

 WGU Task Dark Mode by DK
 
 A dark mode option for Western Governors University task pages. Also includes an option in the context menu (right-click) to make the font sizes bigger without making the buttons in the left pane bigger.

 Covers task pages only, not course pages or textbooks.

 The context menu (right-click) items only appear on WGU task pages (https://tasks.wgu.edu/*).

 This is a work in progress that will be updated to include a browser action menu that includes both the dark mode and large font size options.

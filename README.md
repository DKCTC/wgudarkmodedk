 Chrome extension - WGU Task Dark Mode and Large Text by DK
 
 A Chrome extension that adds dark mode and large font size options for Western Governors University task pages.

 The large font size option makes the text larger without making the buttons in the left pane bigger, which would take away too much content space and make everything harder to read, defeating the purpose of making the text bigger.

 Clicking the browser action button will open a popup with buttons for selecting Dark Mode and Large Text. They will toggle the options for ALL open WGU Task pages.

 The setting is remembered and applied to task pages upon navigation.

 Covers task pages only, not course pages or textbooks.

 There are context menu (right-click) items for toggling these options as well, but they only appear on WGU task pages (https://tasks.wgu.edu/*).

 This will eventually be in the Chrome Web Store. For now, you must download the ZIP and put the contents somewhere and then load it as an unpacked extension in Chrome. Follow the first three steps here: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/

 At some point, the styling on the Task pages will change, and this extension will no longer function properly. Please file an issue, but if I am no longer a student, then I will not be able to access any tasks. Hopefully it does not change before the end of 2023.

 If anything else is not working, please file an issue. Thanks!
